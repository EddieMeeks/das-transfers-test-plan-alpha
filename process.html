		<h1>How to transfer funds to a receiving employer</h1>

		<h2>1. Work out how much funding you’ll have available to transfer</h2>
		<p>You can allocate up to 10% of your annual apprenticeship funds to another business, which is calculated from the total amount of the apprenticeship levy you paid in the last tax year. You can find this on your <a href="https://manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Apprenticeship Service</a> (AS) account.</p>
		<p>We’re currently developing a tool to help you to easily calculate the amount of funds you have available.</p>
		<p>In the meantime, you can use this calculation using information from your AS account:</p>
		<p class="bullets">&#9679; The total apprenticeship levy declared to HMRC by Employer A in the 2017 to 2018 tax year was £500,000</p>
		<p class="bullets">&#9679; 90% of their employees are based in workplaces in England so their ‘English percentage’ is 90%</p>
		<p class="bullets">&#9679; £500,000 x 90% = £450,000</p>
		<p class="bullets">&#9679; Add 10% government top-up. 10% of £450,000 = £45,000, so total is £495,000</p>
		<p class="bullets">&#9679; Employer A’s transfers allowance for 2018/19 is 10% of the above total, so £49,500</p>
		<p>At the end of April, this calculation will be done for you and you will be able to see your 10% transfer allowance in your AS account.</p>

		<h2>2. Find a receiving employer</h2>
		<p>You can transfer funds to any employer, provided they’re not sending any transfers themselves.</p>
		<p>You can find more information on who can receive a transfer <a href="https://dsaengagement.microsoftcrmportals.com/Transfers_Funding_Rules/">here</a>.</p>

		<p>Contact an employer you think might be interested in receiving a transfer using your industry knowledge, connections, and supply chain. Depending on your industry, you may find your supply chain, trade bodies, industry events, an Apprenticeship Training Agency (ATA) or even LinkedIn a useful resource.</p>

		<p>Because the receiving employer may not yet have an AS account, this part of the process can simply be a conversation.</p>

		<h2>3. Decide on the apprenticeship standard</h2>
		<p>Together with the receiving employer decide on which apprenticeship standard your funds will pay for. </p>
		<p>Transferred funds can be used by the receiving employer to train and assess their apprentice, up to the value of £27,000, which is the maximum funding band.</p>

		<h2>4. Agree on the details of the apprenticeship</h2>
		<p>Consider the length of the apprenticeship, the amount of apprentices you’re able to support, and the total cost of the apprenticeship.</p>

		<p>You should feel confident that you can cover the whole cost of the apprenticeship, over the full duration. If you’re no longer able to continue funding an apprenticeship, the receiving employer would be asked to make a 10% contribution and the government will pay the remaining 90%. This is called co-investment.</p>

		<h2>5. Ask the receiving employer to create an account on the DAS</h2>
		<p>Once both employers have agreed on the details of the apprenticeship, the receiving employer should create a DAS account.</p>

 		<p>From here, they’ll be able to select your business as the funding body, work with the training providers, upload details of apprentices, and, finally, confirm both parties are happy to go forwards with the transfer.</p>
