		<h2>All you need to know about transfers for levy-paying employers</h2>
		<p>With over 120 workers, building, servicing and maintaining boats, Beverill Boating Company know a thing or two about yachts.</p>
		<p>Beverill Boating have been training apprentices for over 60 years, and the recent introduction of transfers — a government policy allowing businesses who pay the apprenticeship levy to pass on up to 10% of their apprenticeship service funds to another company for new apprentices — has opened another door for how owner Thomas Moore and his team work with businesses across the boating industry.</p>
		  
		<p class="bulletin">“For us, it’s a partnership and it makes sense that the people working on our yachts are trained to a high standard and can do what we need them to.” Thomas Moore, owner of Beverill Boating Company"</p>
		
		<p>“Transfers let us give another business some of the funding we’ve paid through the apprenticeship levy,” says Thomas. “For small businesses, it’s a real chance to take on an apprentice if they haven’t had the funds to do so before but, for us, it’s a way to work closely with one of the businesses in our supply chain.”</p>
		  
		<p>In this case, it’s Dickson’s Yacht Upholsterers, who have been providing Beverill Boating with bespoke fine furnishings for their yachts for over two decades.</p>
		  
		<p>“Dickson’s have been our preferred upholsterer for years,” adds Thomas. “They’re a small business and through our transfer, they can take on an apprentice for the first time and also upskill one of their existing staff members. For us, it’s a partnership and it makes sense that the people working on our yachts are trained to a high standard and can do what we need them to.”</p>
		  
		<p>Phillip Dickson Jnr, owner of Dickson’s, was excited to have Thomas approach him about the opportunity. “We’re a small, family-run business and what we do has been learned on-the-job and passed down through the family. We’ve never had the funds to take on an apprentice or the time to look into our options — we don’t have a HR team, we do all that ourselves, in between running the business. The transfers scheme has opened doors in how we train our staff.</p>
		  
		<p>“The apprenticeship service was all new to me but Thomas’ knowledge has been invaluable in answering questions and pointing us in the right direction.”</p>
		  
		<p>I sent the information pack that's available on the Apprenticeship Service (AS) and Phillip followed the steps to get his own account set up," says Thomas</p>
		  
		<p>“I’d used the transfers estimating tool to work out how much funding my company could transfer and, from there, we decided upon a training course - using the Find Apprenticeship Training (FAT) website - that would be most beneficial to both our companies.”</p>
		  
		<p>Businesses who receive a transfer can only use the funds to pay for the training and assessment of apprentices, using the new apprenticeship standards.</p>
		  
		<p>“Everything is done through our online account; there’s no actual money being transferred from my business to someone else,” says Thomas. “The funding goes straight to the provider to pay for the training and assessment, which means you know exactly what your money is being used for”.</p>
