		<h2>Please note, this transfer funding rules are part of the Apprenticeship Funding Rules policy. You can find the full document here</h2>
		
		<h3>Introduction for employers</h3>
		<p>&#9679; E173.  From April 2018, levy-paying employers will be able to transfer up to 10% of their levy funds, which were declared for the previous tax year to other employers, including apprenticeship training agencies (ATAs). The 10% transfer allowance is calculated on declared levy multiplied by English percentage, along with the 10% automatic top up from Government. This allowance is recalculated every tax year.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E174.  Employers receiving transferred funds will only be able to use them to pay for training and assessment for apprenticeship standards, for new starts from 1 May 2018. Employers will not be able to use transferred funds to pay for training and assessment for apprenticeship frameworks or apprentices that started before 1 May 2018.</p>
		
		<h3>Rules for sending employers</h3>
		<p>&#9679; E175.  A sending employer is a levy-paying employer who wishes to transfer uncommitted levy funds in their apprenticeship service account to another employer to support their delivery of an apprenticeship standard starting from 1 May 2018. These funds can only be used for the cost of apprenticeship training and assessment.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E176.  We will calculate the transfer allowance around the start of each tax year (the calculation is based on the period 12 levy figure declared to HMRC). The 10% transfer allowance is calculated on declared levy multiplied by the English percentage, along with the 10% automatic top up from Government. If you are part of an account with connected organisations your 10% transfer allowance will be calculated from the total levy declared by all organisations included within the account. You will not have an individual transfer account.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E177.  Provided you do not exceed the 10% transfer cap, you are able to transfer funds to any number of other employers. This may be limited when the new functionality is introduced in April 2018. Details will be communicated on the transfers page on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transferring-apprenticeship-service-funds" target="_blank">GOV.UK.</a></p>
		<p>&#9679; E178.  To send a transfer you must re-sign the <a href="https://dsaengagement.microsoftcrmportals.com/documents/Employer_agreement.pdf" target="_blank">ESFA employer agreement</a>.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E179.  You must agree with the receiving employer which apprenticeship standard their chosen apprentice will be undertaking and the price that they have agreed with their chosen provider and end-point assessment organisation. You will need to confirm these details through the apprenticeship service and ensure you do not exceed your 10% transfer cap.</p><p>&#9679; E180.  By agreeing to fund an apprenticeship with a transfer you are committing to fund 
		the apprenticeship until completion. You will not be able to stop payments once you have approved the apprenticeship on the apprenticeship service.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E181.  The transfer amount should cover 100% of the eligible training and assessment costs, up to the funding band maximum, of the apprenticeship standard. This does not include English and maths training up to and including level 2, which is funded separately.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E182.  You cannot jointly fund an apprenticeship with another levy-paying employer.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E183.  A transfer of funds will not take place where the receiving employer is eligible for full government funding, because they have fewer than 50 employees and the apprentice is:</p>
		<p class="bullets">&#9702; 183.1  16-18 years old; or <br/>
		&#9702; 183.2  An eligible 19-24 year old.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E184.  The eligibility criteria are detailed in the extra support for small employers section <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697364/Employer_rules_v3.pdf" target="_blank">(paragraphs E93 to E96)</a>.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E185.  You must not impose conditions on the transfer, such as choosing the receiving employer’s training provider or end-point assessment organisation for them. </p>
		<p>&#9679; E186.  You must not seek or accept any incentives or inducements or any other payments not authorised by us in exchange for sending a transfer.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E187.  If you are a training provider who is also a levy-paying employer, you must not deliver training to apprentices you are funding through a transfer. This includes where you are acting as a main provider or a sub-contractor.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E188.  The funds that you transfer will retain their initial date of expiry; the date of transfer will not affect this.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E189.  As a sending employer, you will not be able to receive any transferred funds from another levy-paying employer, while you are funding a transfer.</p> 
		
		<h3>Rules for recieving employers</h3>
		<p>&#9679; E190.  A receiving employer is any (levy-paying or non-levy paying) employer who receives a transfer of funds from a levy-paying employer.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E191.  You cannot use a transfer to fund an apprenticeship if you are eligible for full government funding because you have fewer than 50 employees and your apprentice is:</p>
		<p class="bullets">&#9702; 191.1  16-18 years old; or </br>
	  	&#9702; 191.2  An eligible 19-24 year old.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E192.  The eligibility criteria are detailed in the extra support for small employers section <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697364/Employer_rules_v3.pdf" target="_blank">(paragraphs E93 to E96)</a>.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E193.  As a transfer of funds will not take place and the apprenticeship will be 100% funded by government, you must not enter these apprenticeships on your apprenticeship service account.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E194.  For the purposes of apprenticeships funded by a transfer, the receiving employer is treated as a levy-paying employer.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E195.  To receive a transfer you must sign the <a href="https://dsaengagement.microsoftcrmportals.com/documents/Employer_agreement.pdf">ESFA employer agreement</a> and ensure apprenticeships funded by a transfer follow the rules in this document.</p>
	 	<p>&#9679; E196.  The transfer amount you receive should cover 100% of the eligible training and assessment costs, up to the funding band maximum, of the apprenticeship standard. This does not include English and maths training up to and including level 2, which is funded separately.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E197.  You will need to set up an apprenticeship service account, if you do not already have one. You will need to enter details of the apprenticeship that the transferred funds relate to – if you are not a levy-paying employer then you can only use this account for apprentices funded through transferred funds.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E198.  If you already have an apprenticeship service account, you may use this to receive a transfer.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E199.  Apprenticeships that are not being funded through either a transfer, or your own levy funds from your apprenticeship service account, must be delivered by a provider who has a contract with us. These apprenticeships must:</p>
		<p class="bullets">&#9702; 199.1  be funded by government-employer co-investment; and <br/>
		&#9702; 199.2  not be entered on your apprenticeship service account.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E200.  The rules on what apprenticeship funding can be spent on are set out in the eligible costs section at paragraphs <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697364/Employer_rules_v3.pdf" target="_blank">E75 to E80</a>.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E201. Before entering the details on your apprenticeship service account, you must:</p>
		<p class="bullets">&#9702; 201.1 Agree with the sending employer and the training provider which
		apprenticeship standard your apprentice will be undertaking; and<br/>
		&#9702; 201.2 Confirm the price that you have negotiated with your provider. All
		parties will need to approve these details through the apprenticeship service.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E202. If you are a levy-paying employer, you must not transfer funds to other employers
		while you are in receipt of transferred funds.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E203. You must not provide any incentives or inducements or any other payments not
		authorised by us in return for receiving a transfer.</p>
		
		<h3>If the total cost cannot be covered by the transfer</h3>
		<p>&#9679; E204. If you do not pay the levy or have exhausted the funds in your apprenticeshipservice account, and at any point the ‘sending’ employer has insufficient funds tocover the cost of your apprenticeship training you must pay co-investment to your provider for the remainder.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E205. If you are a levy-paying employer, if at any point the ‘sending’ employer has
		insufficient funds to cover the cost of your apprenticeship training and you have
		sufficient levy funds available then these funds will automatically be used before
		you enter co-investment.</p>
		<p>&#9679; E206. If the total negotiated price of the apprenticeship exceeds the funding band
		maximum, you must pay all additional costs.</p>
		
		<h3>Monitoring</h3>
		<p>&#9679; E207. We will monitor transfer activity to ensure apprenticeship funding is used
		appropriately, and may take action were you do not meet the terms and conditions
		of using apprenticeship funding. These terms and conditions are set out in these
		funding rules and the ESFA employer agreement.</p>
